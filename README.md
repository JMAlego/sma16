# sma16

SMA16 is a weird little architecture I came up with on holiday with 16bit blocks of memory split into 4 bits for instruction and 12 for data, however data is commonly loaded from another instruction's data section which didn't need it... an interesting challenge to code for, self modifying code is basically required.
